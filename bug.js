This error occurs when using the `expo-updates` package in Expo.  It happens when the app tries to fetch updates from the Expo servers but fails to connect or receive a valid response.  This can manifest as a blank screen, the app crashing, or an error message in the console related to network issues or invalid update data.  The specific error messages vary depending on the cause of the problem, but they often relate to network connectivity problems or issues with the Expo server itself. For example you might see something like `Network request failed` or an error indicating a problem parsing the update manifest.
