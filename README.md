# Expo Updates Failure: Network Request Failed or Invalid Manifest

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `expo-updates` package in Expo applications. The problem arises when the app fails to connect to the Expo servers to retrieve update information, resulting in the app not updating or displaying an error.

## Problem Description

The application fails to check for and apply updates from the Expo servers. This might manifest as:

- A blank screen upon launch
- The app crashing unexpectedly
- Error messages in the console relating to network issues or the parsing of update manifests.

## Solution

The solution focuses on robust error handling and network resilience. This includes implementing mechanisms to check network connectivity, retry failed requests, and gracefully handling invalid update manifests.  The provided solution incorporates these techniques to improve the reliability of the update process. Note: Solutions may also involve checking your Expo backend setup and ensuring the update manifest is correctly generated and served.
